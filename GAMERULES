RULES
• TURNS - The Musketeers always go first. Each player makes one move before passing to their opponent.
• MUSKETEER - On the Musketeers’ turn, a musketeer can move to an adjacent orthogonal (neighboring,
  non-diagonal) cell occupied by a guard, capturing it and occupying that cell.
• GUARD - On the Guards’ turn, a guard can move to an adjacent orthogonal empty cell.
• GOALS -
– The Musketeers win if they cannot capture any guards AND if they are not on the same row or column.
– The guards win if all the musketeers are on the same row or column at any point in the game.
